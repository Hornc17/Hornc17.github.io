    <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
    <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/articles/github-pages-via-web-app/happy-ice-cream.gif" />
    <p>I started coding in college and studied DMET as a minor.</p>
    <p>After graduating and having no luck with getting a job in my field I choose to turn towards codecademy to teach myself some more languages in code.</p>
